   Stacy's mom has got it goin' on  (x2)
...mom 

Stacy do you remember when I mowed your lawn  (mowed your lawn)
your mom came out with just a towel on
I could tell she likes me from the way she stared
and the way she said: "you missed a spot over there"

And I know that you think it's just a fantasy
but since your dad walked out your mom could use a guy like me

(Chorus)
