here are the correct words to bullet with butterfly wings

The world is a vampire,sent to drain.
secret destroyers,hold you up to the flames
and what do i get for my pains
betrayed desires and a piece of game

ever though i know
isuppose ill show all my cool and cold
like old job

despite all my rage im still just a rat in a cage  x2
then someone will say what is lost can never be saved
(first line again)

now im naked nothing but an animal
but can you fake it for just one more show
and what do i get when you feel the same

(chorus)

tell me im the only one
tell me theres no other one
jesus was a only son
tell me im the only one
jesus was a only son for you

(chorus)

tell me im the only one
tell me theres no other one
jesus was a only son for you

and i still belive that i can not be saved   x3
