Chorus:

C
Last night she said
            Dm  
Oh, Baby, I feel so down
        G
Oh, and turned me off
        Em        Dm
When I feel left out
   C
So I, I turned around
            Dm  
Oh, Baby, I don't care no more
       G
I know this for sure
       Em              Dm
I'm walking out that door

C
Well, I've been in town
For just about fifteen minutes now
            Dm 
Oh, Baby, I feel so down
      G
And I don't know why
        Em           Dm  
I keep walking for miles

 F                        G       
But the people they don't understand
 F                          G  
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
 F                         G 
Your grandsons, they won't understand
 F                                G
On top of this I ain't ever gonna understand



C
Last night she said
            Dm
Oh, Baby, I feel so down
         G
Oh, and turned me off
       Em         Dm 
When I feel left out
   C
So I, I turned around
               Dm
Oh, Baby, I'm gonna be alright
         G
It was a great big lie
      Em           Dm   
As I left that night, yeah


(Solo) C F G

    F                  G
Oh, people they don't understand
    F                       G
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
    F                     G
In spaceships, they won't understand
    F                      G
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand

C
Last night she said
            Dm
Oh, Baby, I feel so down
         G
She had turned me off
        Em       Dm 
When I feel left out
 
   C
So I, I turned around
                   Dm            
Oh, little girl, I don't care no more
       G
I know this for sure
            Em       Dm 
I'm walking out that door, yeah


C F G
