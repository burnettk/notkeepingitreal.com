WARNING

Intro
A D G D x4

Verse w/intro
This is a public service announcement
This is only a test
Emergency evacuation protest
May impair your ability to operate machinery
Can't quite tell, just what it means to me
Keep out of reach of children
Don't talk to strangers
Get your philosophy from a bumper sticker

Chorus w/intro
Warning: Live without warning
Warning: Live without warning

Bridge

Verse w/intro
Better homes and safety-sealed communities?
Did you remember to pay the utility?
Caution: police line: you better not cross
Is it the Cop or am I the one that's really dangerous?
Sanitation, Expiration date, Question Everything?
Or shut up and be the victim of authority

Chorus w/intro
Warning: Live without warning
Warning: Live without warning           x2
