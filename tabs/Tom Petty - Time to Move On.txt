      G  D  G  D  G  Bm  A  G

G                 D  G           D
It's time to move on,time to get going
G          D            Bm        A
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
G            D        G         D
But under my feet,baby,grass is growing
G                Bm   A                G
It's time to move on, it's time to get going

G      D       G                   D
Broken skyline, movin' through the airport
G                 D
She's an honest deflector
Bm              A
Conscientious objector 
               G
Now her own protector

G      D       G             D
Broken skyline, which way to love land
G                      D
Which way to something better
Bm              A
Which way to forgiveness
               G
Which way do I go

G            D   G           D      
Time to move on, time to get going
G          D            Bm        A
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
G            D           G        D
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
G                 Bm  A           G
It's time to move on, time to get going

G    D


G        D      G           D
Sometime later, getting the words wrong
G           D           Bm         A
Wasting the meaning and losing the rhyme
G        D
Nauseous adrenalin
G                  D
Like breakin' up a dogfight
G                  D
Like a deer in the headlights
Bm        A     
Frozen in real time
          G
I'm losing my mind


G            D   G           D
Time to move on, time to get going
G         D             Bm        A
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
G            D           G        D
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
G                 Bm  A                G      
It's time to move on, it's time to get going

Repeat twice

Ends on a D
