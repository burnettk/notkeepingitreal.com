Cary Brothers - Blue Eyes - INTRO/MAIN RIFF (this is 80 lines long by the way)
E, then hammer on from E note (5 th string, 7th fret) to F# note (5th string, 9th fret) and back to the E note, all without muting the open E up top (6th string), then back to chords - B C#m B (x2) - this is played through verses and choruses

E/B-C#m-B (x4)
Wish enough, wise man'll tell you a lie
Window broke, torn up screens
Who'd have thought that you'd dream
Of a single tragic scene


PRE-CHORUS:
A                                        C#m
I just wanna sing a song with you

A                                     B
I just want to take it off of you


CHORUS
 E/B
Cause blue eyes

C#m          B
You are all that i need

E/B
Cause blue eyes

C#m          B
You're the sweet to my mean


E/B-C#m-B (x4)
Fess it up, dot on the palm of your hand
I can help you to stand
Saved it up for this dance
Tell me all the things you can

A/C#m/A/B
I just wanna sing a song with you
I just wanna be the one that's true

E/B-C#m-B (x4)
Cause blue eyes
You're the secret I keep
Cause blue eyes


F#m                         A
All the lights on and you are alive

E                                                  B
But you can't point the way to your heart

F#m                            A
So sublime, when the stars are aligned

E
But you don't know

C#m                                         B
You don't know the greatness you are


E/B-C#m-B (x4)
Cause blue eyes
You are destiny's scene
Cause blue eyes
I just wanna be the one

A-C#m-A-B
I just wanna sing a song with you
I just wanna get it on with you

E/B-C#m-B (and repeat)
Cause blue eyes
You're the secret I keep
Cause blue eyes

I just wanna sing a song with you (and repeat)
