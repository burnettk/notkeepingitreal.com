"500 miles"  by The Proclaimers

       E
When I wake up yeah I know I'm gonna be
          A              B                E
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you
       E
When I go out yeah I know I'm gonna be
          A              B               E
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you

     E
If I get drunk yes I know I'm gonna be
          A              B                  E
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you
         E
And if I haver yeah I know I'm gonna be
          A                B           E
I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you

{Chorus}
But I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more
Just to be the man who walked 1,000 miles
To fall down at your door

When I'm working yes I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's working hard for you
And when the money comes in for the work I'll do
I'll pass almost every penny on to you

When I come home yeah I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you
And if I grow old well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you

When I'm lonely yes I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you
When I'm dreaming yes I know I'm gonna dream
Dream about the time when I'm with you
