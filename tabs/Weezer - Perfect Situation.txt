Weezer - Perfect Situation

( F# C# G# C# ) 
What's the deal with my brain? 
Why am I so obviously insane? 
In a perfect situation 
I let love down the drain. 
There's the pitch, slow and straight. 
All I have to do is swing 
and I'm the hero, but I'm the zero. 
Hungry nights, once again 
Now it's getting unbelievable. 
'Cause I could not have it better, 
But I just can't get no play 
From the girls, all around 
As they search the night for someone to hold onto. 
I just pass through...

singing... 
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh. 
Singing... 
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh. 
 
( F# C# G# C# ) 
Get your hands off the girl, 
Can't you see that she belongs to me? 
And I don't appreciate this excess company. 
Though I can't satisfy all the needs she has 
And so she starts to wander... 
Can you blame her?

singing... 
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh. 
Singing... 
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh. 
 
( D#m C# G# C# ) 
Tell me there's a logic out there. 
Leading me to better prepare 
For the day that something really special might come. 
Tell me there's some hope for me. 
I don't wanna be lonely 
For the rest of my days on the earth.
