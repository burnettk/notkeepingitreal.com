I'm a software developer.
I write something here from time to time.
I work on [SpiffWorkflow](https://spiffworkflow.org).
Here, have some [tabs](/tabs).

Since the content on this site is somewhat overwhelmed by unedited notes from conference talks (which probably aren't really worth reading), here are some of my favorite posts:
