-   I went about integrating a GPS and a Digital Camera to create a new kind of website. It would combines pictures, GPS tracks and user notes. The result was [walkingboss](http://walkingboss.com).

-   Mashup definition from wikipedia: A mashup is a website or web application that uses content from more than one source to create a completely new web application.

-   Maps are mad hot. People are enchanted by them. That’s why every second web developer has written a mashup involving the google maps api.

-   The impetus for the site was that I was going to run an ultra-marathon, and since I was pretty sure I wasn’t going to run a fricking ultra-marathon again, I wanted to preserve the memory somehow.

### Mad simple steps to use the site

-   Go on a trek with your GPS
-   Snap some photos
-   Upload your GPS log and timestamped photos to the site and you’ve got an integrated track.

### Lessons Learned

-   This web 2.0 isn’t all that bad after all
-   There’s mad free api’s out there: search, maps, photos, movies, music
-   Rails is a great glue for these things (and he claims to have written about glue before the linux journal article).

-   On an unrelated note: when dude arrived at the conference, he realized that the [railsconf facebook](http://facebook.railsconf.com) didn’t have an api. He then informed us that apparently now [it does](http://facebook.guod.net). *It’s pretty unreasonable to be able to throw that together in about a day. Rock on man.*

-   Called out [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com) and nasty little problems, which are the ones that you don’t learn anything from. Luckily rails helps you avoid the nasty little problems and keep the momentum going.

-   Check out [http://walkingboss.com](http://walkingboss.com) to get into the beta!

*Dude seems mad genuine. Much love.*
