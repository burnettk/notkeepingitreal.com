*The presentation started off with renditions of “You Shook Me All Night Long” and “Enter Sandman” on the accordion, which was, obviously, the hottest thing ever*

“How the hell am I going to pull off a comparison of AC/DC Stravinsky, and Rails?”

### AC/DC

-   Adams Law of AC/DC: You know the title, you know the chorus. This works well with the rails concept of rails routes, whereby knowing the URL tells you a lot about where to the find the code for that page.
-   AC/DC doesn’t add unnecessary notes (no really, there are very few notes), and rails doesn’t make you add unnecessary code.
-   AC/DC is consistent. It’s strait up rock, and it’s always about sex or drugs or rock and roll. All rails primary keys are called id. ’nuff said.
-   Bus Factor (when AC/DC lost their lead singer and got a new frontman, they proceeded to release one of their best albums - Back in Black). Rails also makes it easy to spread the knowledge around a programming team (by limiting complexity).

### Igor Stravinsky - The Rite of Spring

-   Takes 110 peope to perform (and we know how big a pain in the ass it can be to coordinate communication with two people).
-   It isn’t necessary or desirable to emulate the complexity of The Rite of Spring when building your rails app.
-   Part of the piece is in 11/4 time, which is a bit nonconformist, as rails has historically been as well.
-   A New York Taxi driver joke goes, “How do you get to Carnegie Hall?” (Answer: practice) It takes about 1000 years of total training time to get people equipped to perform The Rite of Spring. Yeah, again, don’t build software like that.

All of these things (AC/DC, The Rite of Spring, and Rails) have a tendency to cause problems. The dancing in The Rite of Spring caused chairs to be thrown, and rails leads to flame wars. This is because all of these things incite **passion**. While Microsoft may say, “we need people who are non-threateningly dressed to build great solutions,” the rails community understands that value comes from the margins. AC/DC has created, Stravinsky created, and rails allows us to create. We’d like to think that, like AC/DC and Stravinsky, our work is not a discipline, but a craft.

Big Balls was then played on the accordion. *I take it back, **that** was the hottest thing ever*
