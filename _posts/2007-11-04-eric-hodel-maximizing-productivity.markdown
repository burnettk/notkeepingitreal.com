I was having it out with my wife on the telephone for the beginning of this talk.

Main points:

-   Test
-   KISS/YAGNI
-   Do what you want
-   Hack often
-   Automate
-   Eliminate pain
-   Have fun

Don’t burn out. Use autotest. Learn new things at conferences. Do pair programming. In fact, I’ve done gang-bang programming, where one guy is typing with the computer projected and a bunch of other backseat drivers are yelling out code. The guy is only allowed to type what someone else says.

Q/A time:

-   Person with question: So it seems like a lot of people use the ruby mailing list to submit patches rather than using the tracking system. WTF?
-   Hodel: Yeah, I don’t know. Matz?
-   Matz: I like email
-   Hodel: There you go, Matz uses email as his tracking system

-   Person with question: What’s your editor of choice?
-   Hodel: Vim [that’s right]
