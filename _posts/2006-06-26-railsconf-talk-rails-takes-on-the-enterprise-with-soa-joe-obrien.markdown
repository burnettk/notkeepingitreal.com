-   Have you read any books on Service Oriented Architectures (SOA). Yeah? Well forget everything
-   Some applications really need to be big.
-   Just because rails allows you to do things ten times faster doesn’t mean you need to do ten times more. Do the important things **better**.
-   SOA is not a new idea, but our era of developers may have lost the art of making applications that communicate with each other.
-   SOA is about boundaries - discovering the logical separations between various parts of the business.
-   Must have well-defined interfaces.
-   XML is **not** the root of all evil.
-   Do not expose your privates (in reference to xml dtd’s of course)
-   Asyncronous messaging is certainly an option when trying to improve the user experience.
