### [iBatis](http://ibatis.apache.org)

-   Do not use this Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tool.
-   Okay, use this ORM tool if you absolutely cannot accomplish what you need to with ActiveRecord.
-   It allows/forces you to manually create the sql that you need to get the objects that fit into your domain model.

*Yeah, I didn’t get too much out of this talk. I probably don’t really ever want to use iBatis all that much.*
