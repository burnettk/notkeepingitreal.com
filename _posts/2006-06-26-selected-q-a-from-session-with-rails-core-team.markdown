*When’s rails 2.0 coming out?*

We’ve got to clean some stuff up first. The API will break some old stuff, and rails will lose its backwards compatibility for the first time. We’re pretty focused on 1.2 for now. There’s no rush for 2.0.

*What are the strengths and weaknesses of rails in the corporate environment?*

Don’t change rails for the corporate environment; fix the corporate environment to work with rails.

*Coke or Pepsi?*

Coke.

*Do you guys hate database fixtures as much as me?*

Yes. (The guy from cd baby doesn’t use them)

*These guys got a lot of love from the audience, gave a lot of love back back to the audience, and gave a lot of love to each other as well. It was a neat way to end the conference. And the standing ovation at the end: well-deserved.*
