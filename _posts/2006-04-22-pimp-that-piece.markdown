It’s the third day this blog has been in production, and as such, it’s about time to [wax](http://notkeepingitreal.com/pages/language) the default Typo theme.

Azure, as it’s dubbed, was pretty hot [a year ago](http://blog.leetsoft.com/articles/2005/04/28/introducing-azure) , but these days there’s so many kids using it that it just doesn’t seem necessary to add one more. The new theme is still mostly stolen from the same, but I went ahead and blasted the color scheme and made the layout fluid in the process.
