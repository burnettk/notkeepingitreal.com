Jruby is already kind of an easy sell in big companies. It’s the quickness of rails with the familiarity of java.

But

I’m not trying to to sell JRuby to enterprises [well clearly, or else he wouldn’t be giving this talk at rubyconf].

JRuby can work well, even for startups - it’s just about choosing the best tool for the job.

Why might one choose JRuby?

-   performance
-   library support (in fact, we wanted Lucene for search!)
-   extending the language without using C

Getting started:

-   easy install
-   don’t use textmate to code java
-   casting can be tricky (java needs arrays to have only one type of object in them, ruby not so much)
