How delightful to be awake at 9:00 and to witness this microsoft employee trying not to get tarred and feathered by the rubyconf hoardes. Sounds like the timeframe for the release of IronRuby is fairly loose. It will certainly be interesting to see how ruby running in the .net CLR will affect the future of ruby.
