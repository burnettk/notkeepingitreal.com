-   “I’ve been Java free for 15 months. It’s been a long time, but not long enough.”
-   Testing?! What’s in it for me? Testing won’t be as fun as working on the app, right? But
-   Tests are, in part, the insurance for the app staying fun.
-   Law of Unintended Consequences: almost all human actions have at least one unintended consequence.
-   When difficulties with dependencies become an excuse for not testing make a mock object.
-   Anything that sounds like a story is likely a good candidate for an integration test.
-   If you find yourself asking, “How am I going to test this?”, it might be an indication that the application isn’t particularly usable.
-   While testing can slow you down in the very short term, the irony of all of this is that testing can actually help you write better code **faster**.
