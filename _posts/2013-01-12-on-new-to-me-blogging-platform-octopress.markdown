There was a [serious security hole](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ) affecting ruby on rails announced the the other day, and this blog was affected. It was also affected by hundreds of other security holes, since I hadn't upgraded my blog engine, [typo](http://typosphere.org/), since 2006. :)

Since attackers could have executed arbitrary ruby code on my shared hosting instance, I decided it was time do something, so I checked out [a comparison site](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/Blog_Engines), discovered that [octopress](http://octopress.org/) is the most popular ruby blogging system these days, and decided to switch. So far so good; thanks for the migration tools, octopress!
