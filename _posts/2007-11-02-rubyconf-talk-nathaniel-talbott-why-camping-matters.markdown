Dude, Talbott, has actually spoken at all seven ruby conferences - damn dude. He gave love to [why](http://whytheluckystiff.net), and started live coding a blog in camping: creating posts, viewing posts, adding comments - good stuff.

Now, breaking some eggs

Contrasting camping with rails:

-   rails favors convention over configuration, but camping has **no configuration**.
-   rails is boring ([david](http://loudthinking.com) said so); camping is zesty
-   rails encourages conformance; camping encourages experimentation

Dude got all sales and marketing-centric, and realized while hacking one day that feeding his creative side is incredibly important. Regular, varied and appealing tasks are what we need - if we learn something new at every turn, no matter how small, we will be happier and more productive.

Talked Rubyconf vs. Railsconf:

-   hobbyists at rubyconf, professionals at railsconf
-   generalists in ruby, focus in rails
-   vitality from ruby, momentum from rails

Thanks for coming; now help out our ruby community - go hack something!
