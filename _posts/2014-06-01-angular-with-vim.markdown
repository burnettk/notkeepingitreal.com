I've created an [Angular with Vim screencast](http://youtu.be/-tEaY7HsTn8) to accompany [vim-angular](https://github.com/burnettk/vim-angular), a plugin I wrote that helps to improve the AngularJS editing experience in Vim.

The two things I'm happiest about with this--besides being able to use the plugin every day--are:

1. This is the first screencast I've recorded for something I wrote
1. The plugin itself is well tested (with [vimrunner](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/vimrunner), a way to drive vim with ruby).
