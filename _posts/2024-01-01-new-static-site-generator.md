title: New Static Site Generator
---

I had been using octopress for many years.
It stopped being maintained in 2015 or so, it seems.
It was based on jekyll, a ruby static site generator, so I went ahead and just adopted jekyll, mostly to ease the transition.
My kid picked [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/) for the theme.
I approve; it's quite cute.

This wasn't a new year's resolution or anything.
I made it live a week or so ago, but this is the first time I've had a chance to write a new post.
