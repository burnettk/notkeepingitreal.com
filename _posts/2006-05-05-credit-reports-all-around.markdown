I read [somewhere](http://home.ingdirect.com/privacy/privacy.asp?s=IdentityTheft) that “The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (The FACT Act) entitles all Americans over the age of 18 to receive one free credit report from all three credit reporting agencies.” I checked it out, so here’s [wagwan](http://notkeepingitreal.com/pages/language)

You apparently have a right to know what’s going on with your credit, but you apparently don’t have a right to get your actual numerical credit score for free. Damn.

I believe one of the companies offered to give me a number for six bucks, but that seems pretty steep after I thought it was coming in the mail for free. On the up side, the reports are fairly complete, completely free (once a year), reasonable straitforward - and they came about three days after I called in the request.

You can check out [the service](http://www.annualcreditreport.com) online or use their toll free number, 1-877-FACTACT, to hook yourself up.
