Right, so I’m at the [First International Rails Conference](http://railsconf.com) in Chicago from June 23-25. I’ll probably be dropping a good number of notes about the same in the next couple of days, mostly in case anyone at work asks about what I was doing at 1:30pm on Friday (I don’t plan to remember otherwise).
