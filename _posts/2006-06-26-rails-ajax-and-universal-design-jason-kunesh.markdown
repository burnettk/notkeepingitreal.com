### Let’s chat accessibility, shall we

-   For web design, big things are beautiful, and the center of the screen is the most important.
-   If you take one thing away from this talk: Every 20 minutes, you should look up from the monitor for at least 20 seconds.
-   The computing experience for the blind is mad different than we think. *This guy told us that experienced users of screen readers often use playback speeds of 300 words per minute. He played us a sample of a screen reader at 100 wpm and it sounded ridiculously fast.*
-   Screenreaders really tend to struggle with ajax.

### Personas

-   When trying to figure out usability, use personas to smooth out the rough edges; individuals are quirky and don’t usually represent the masses.
-   You’ll figure out primary, secondary, and negative personas - the primary one is the loyal customer that you want to build for.

### The Usability/Accessibility Conundrum

-   Accessibility is not necessarily usability (fat phones with fat buttons aren’t very usable for anyone).
-   Usability is not accessibility (car seats work for everyone except someone in a wheelchair).
-   But accessibility can certainly help with usability (easy grip kitchen utensils are hard to complain about).

### Do your best

-   Think a little bit, follow web standards, and you’ll be a good part of way towards creating accessible sites.
